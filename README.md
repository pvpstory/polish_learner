# Polish Learner ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

A personalized AI-powered flashcard application for learning Polish vocabulary, built with SwiftUI for macOS. This app combines spaced repetition algorithms with AI-generated definitions and usage examples to create an effective language learning experience.

## âœ¨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **AI-Powered Learning**: Generate definitions and usage examples using Google's Gemini AI through Firebase
- **Smart Spaced Repetition**: Modified SM-2 algorithm with a learning stage system (inspired by Anki)
- **Active Recall Testing**: Write your own examples that are evaluated by AI
- **Persistent Storage**: SwiftData integration for seamless data persistence
- **Native macOS Experience**: Built entirely with SwiftUI

### Learning System
- **Two-Stage Learning Process**:
  - **Learning Stage**: Initial familiarization without affecting difficulty ratings
  - **Review Stage**: Traditional spaced repetition with SM-2 algorithm
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Cards adjust their review intervals based on your performance
- **AI Feedback**: Get instant evaluation on your usage examples

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI (macOS)
- **Data Persistence**: SwiftData
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini via Firebase AI SDK
- **Algorithm**: Custom implementation of SM-2 spaced repetition with learning stage modifications

### Key Technical Achievements
- Modified SM-2 algorithm implementation with pre-spaced repetition learning phase
- Seamless AI API integration for dynamic content generation
- Clean SwiftUI architecture with proper data flow
- Efficient local data management with SwiftData

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma)
- Xcode 15.0+
- Firebase project with Gemini AI enabled

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polish-learner.git
   cd polish-learner
   ```

2. **Firebase Configuration**
   - coming soon

3. **Build and Run**
   - Open `Polish Learner.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Build and run on macOS

### Demo Alternative
Since setting up Firebase can be complex for quick evaluation, a demo video showcasing all features will be added soon to demonstrate the app's functionality.

## ðŸ“š Learning Journey

This project represents my first deep dive into several technologies:
- **SwiftUI Development**: First experience building a complete SwiftUI application
- **iOS/macOS Development**: Learning Swift and Apple's development ecosystem
- **AI Integration**: First time implementing AI API calls in a mobile application
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Translating academic spaced repetition research into working code

The app was built primarily for personal use, focusing on creating a tool that matched my specific learning style and needs without the limitations and costs of commercial alternatives.

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Customization Options**:
  - Option to disable AI features for offline use
  - Customizable review intervals
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive statistics and learning analytics
- **Enhanced UI**: Visual polish and improved user experience
- **Smart Notifications**: Intelligent reminder system for reviews
- **Multi-language Support**: Extend beyond Polish to other languages
- **Prompts**: Better AI prompts to serve different needs


## ðŸ’¡ Project Motivation

This app was born out of frustration with existing AI-powered flashcard applications that either:
- Charged expensive monthly subscriptions for AI features
- Lacked my target language and customization options for specific learning needs 
- Didn't offer the exact feature combination I wanted

By building my own solution, I achieved complete control over the learning experience while avoiding recurring costs - making it both a technical challenge and a practical solution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals Achieved

âœ… Built a fully functional language learning application  
âœ… Implemented complex spaced repetition algorithms  
âœ… Integrated modern AI capabilities  
âœ… Created a personalized learning tool that I actively use  
âœ… Gained proficiency in SwiftUI and macOS development  
âœ… Successfully called and integrated external AI APIs  
âœ… Developed a cost-effective alternative to expensive AI flashcard apps  
âœ… Achieved complete customization freedom for personal learning style
